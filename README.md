This is the second to last project on the foundations course on The Odin Project.

Yhis project will allow me to practise what I've learnt regarding DOM manipulation and 
of course test the knowledge that I acquired during this course.

I hope after finishing this project that I'll be better with my problem solving skill and
how to manipulate the DOM to the desired outcome.

This as a website that should allow to to "etch" a "sketch" on a 16x16 canvas created with divs.
